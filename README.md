# Nine Card  

This is an implementation of a Rummy-like game called Nine Card. It contains core game logic allowing the user to simulate games between bots who follow different strategies. Be sure to check out the analysis to learn the optimal strategy. A future iteration of this project will allow a user to play games against a bot, setting the difficulty anywhere from random to expert.  

For more information on the rules and history of this rummy variant, please see this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumino).

The files in this repository are:  

- scripts: A folder that contains all the python scripts needed to run the game. This contains `scoring.py`, `gameLogic.py`, `strategies.py`, and `test_strategies.py`  
- notes: This contains a note with descriptions of different strategies that we plan to implement.  
- Analysis.ipynb: An iPyhon notebook to play games and present our findings.
